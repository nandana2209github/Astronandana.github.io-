            Let's discuss the Planet that generates wealth. And how to see the wealth from two different perspectives :
            
            There are two different perspective through which we can see the Wealth.
            
            1. Maya &
            
            2. Dharma
            
            Let's understand why the certain houses and planets which tells us the secrets of wealth which rules a certain aspect of life. <b>What is wealth in Astrology ?</b> Wealth is basically accumulated money, assets Properties, Happiness, Health & your capabilities to give others. Let's say someone has many bank accounts, many vehicles , many properties that are also wealth. But at the same time someone earns less but there is contentment in their life so this is also a certain kind of wealth. 2nd house is greatly connected to your bank account. Your purchase power . (If money is in the account then only you will be intended to buy something). Your gain are seen by your 11th house , 11 th house is basically your running income, gain something. Supposed you gain a property, you have to earn that money & you have to pay someone to buy something so the 11th house is the source of input. 2nd house gives you the power which you power to collect the happiness which comes from 4th house. So the wealth gives the ultimate satisfaction . There are Two planets which is responsible for wealth. The first planet which deals with material success MAYA that is Venus. Venus rules two houses Taurus and Libra. Taurus - House of personal satisfaction, security, grounding it gives you enough resources to run your life. Libra - Libra gives you balance of your life. Balance means when you say you have too much of good then you have to face equivalent amount of bad that is called balance. When you say I achieve balance it means you have Sattva as well as Tamas. Venus is a kind of planet which gives you the kind of wealth which you can't hold, but to spend. Venus is a planet of Luxuries, emotions, materialistic relations, wealth generation like gold, silver, assets, building all the powerful and positive things you have. But it takes away your Honest year of your life to earn it, even you are rich and you think that you don't have to work much. Life is not limited to one birth if life was limited to one birth then Astrology won't exist because it runs on the theory of multiple birth and karma.
            
            <p class="font2">2nd kind of Wealth:  </p>
           
            <p class="font2"> Jupiter is responsible for these kind of wealth. There is another kind of wealth, Knowledge wealth, Spritual wealth, not just money but it can be there is a person who is not having enough money to feed himself but understood the truth of life and prosper in life in different way. A venus dominated person can spend five times more than usual required. But when venus, Moon is balanced and Jupiter is dominated in the chart then wealth generation will be in very different level, it will be more logical, more understanding with the situation you are in and with a kind of positive Jupiter you have but still keep on growing. So if Jupiter is exalted or positive in a chart it gives you prosperity with knowledge and gives you prosperity in little slower than venus. Because venus is fast moving planet. Venus is balanced, one hand you take from the other hand you give. Jupiter is a slow moving planet and it takes time , it teaches, it gives you the capability to give. Jupiter rules your Bhagya , Dharma sthan 9th house & also 12th house, 12th house is about losses but 12th house is also about your capability to give. 12th house is 2nd from 11th house. 11th house is your gains, you are getting money do it is increasing capacity to give or spend. So if gains comes and you choose to bind the wealth then 12th house will be activated and it leads to spending your gain in either medical or on some unwanted situations where you don't want to spend. Nobody can bind the wealth in simple words blessings of "MATA LAKSHMI". Jupiter rules Pieces the ocean & surprisingly Venus becomes exalted in Pieces, because when the prosperity of Jupiter kicks in then it becomes boundless limitless, you will get luxury but you will live a simple life . There are many people who are billionaires but yet choose to live life in very simple way & doesn't display much. Jupiter generated wealth can carry forward in the next life. But Venus generated wealth can't carry forwarded for the next life. It's not that Venus generated wealth is bad, there is no harm in buying & even showing off wealth, it's just that to achieve that have you done that happily peacefully or struggled just to show off. If you are struggling just to show off then your Venus is actually eating up the time line that is why Venus is called "Daitya Guru", "The Maya Pati". Venus generates Maya & Maya binds you that's why Venus is Markesh 2nd & 7th house lord. But Jupiter frees you it can never be Markesh, even if it rules 12th house. If a person is earning little can be wealthy in his own terms but on other side a person having billions may eat medicines & having sleepless nights. So the real wealthis contentment.</p>
