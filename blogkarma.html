          <b> karma is mysterious</b> It chases it's doer as the calf recognises it's mother even in the herd.
           Karma is very important to understand, it helps you to change colour of your life.
           There are many types of karma : karma is the baggage of your karma which is being carried by your casual body,
           Sanchit but you can change it by your purusharth.
           When you take complete analysis of your karma it is divided into many:</p>
           <p class="font2">

           1. <b>Nitya karma:</b> Nitya karma means the karma which you do in regular routine manner. Whatever you are doing in your nitya karma should be  in happily adherence, no cribbing. Whatever you do for your body, job, relationship should be completely accepted and with complete devotion.</p>

           <p class="font2">
           2. <b>Nai-Nitya karma:</b>  This is daily duties, obligatory but conditional. when occassion demands like wedding,  hawan,  Shraddha our dharmik needs.work hard and Happy adherence of nitya karma is nai-nitya karma you can choose to do
           These could include rituals performed during festivals, ceremonies related to birth and death, or specific actions taken to remedy calamities or misfortunes.</p>

           <p class="font2">
           3. <b>Kamya karma:</b> Kamya karma is connected to your desires , pleasure. kamya karmas are pleasures oriented  they consume energy and they create hurdles in your spritual evolution. Kamya karma should minimize for spritual seeker. Kamya karma gives you pleasures and joy to your heart and boost up your ego . They eats lot's of energy. We should understand while we are more indulge in kamya karma the more spending of our accumulated punya karma from many previous births.  People should store their and utilities in conscious evolution. </p>
            
            
         <p class="font2">
             4. <b>Nishit karma:</b>
             Nishit means "banned", Not considered good karma. Nishit karma is very bad they are absolutely anti evolution, in fact they create more negative karmic baggage. Nishit karma are not morally aligned with the moral and social order, they don't aligned with your soul's evolution. Nishit karma are backbiting, gossiping,  doing something really crafty to defend someone & to insult someone & rob, cheat, stab someone or play politics with someone. Nishit karma make your journey heavy and many of the Nishit karma should kept under microscope. One should avoid indulge in these kind of karma to not create karmic baggage. If you are born with wisdom of previous life will have deep understanding that I don't have to indulge in any kind of Nishit karma & they have to bear whatever they have done in their past life because it's completely your karma , better to accept all the circumstances of present life which life is bringing on the table for you . Just accept without any reaction, while you react you create another karma baggage. Kamya karma might give you pleasures for your ego but they create a-lot of baggage. One should be very observant about this    </p>
           
         
          <p class="font2">
              5. <b>Prayaschit karma:</b> prayaschit karma is wonderful karma . One should educate themselves and bring it into Nitya karma categories. Prayaschit karma is the understanding that whatever I'm suffering in this life time wheather health issues, financial issues, relationship issues or any kind of mental suffering, this is the result of my own karma baggage, one should take responsibility of it. It's our backlog & we have to deal it in this life time. Prayaschit karma is taking commitment to forgiveness writting a gratitude journal every day.<p>

          <p class="font2">
              6.<b> Nishkam karma:</b> Nishkam karma is extremely powerful concept that encourages individuals to perform actions   with     detachment  selflessness & dedication leading to spritual growth & inner peace. Sadhana also come in Nishkam karma , do daily chanting  prayer in front of god without any Kamna.  Help people without making announcement to everywhere, don't make it ego orientation, just make it as a way of life.
